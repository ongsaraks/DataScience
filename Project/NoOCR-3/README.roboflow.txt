The dataset includes 1821 images.
SOBO_WP_4200-YAMANO_LPP_20 are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.33 percent of pixels
