## About Dataset

# About the data and what to doâ€¦

publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, **as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.**

We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/investing/peer-to-peer).

Here are what the columns represent:

- credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
- purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase", "small_business", and "all_other").
- int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.
- installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.
- log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.
- dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).
- fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.
- days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.
- revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).
- revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).
- inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.
- delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.
- pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).
