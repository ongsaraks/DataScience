    "\n",
    "Mutable: You can change them after creation (add, remove, modify elements).\n",
    "Ordered: Elements have a specific order, and you can access them by their position (index).\n",
    "Syntax: Created using square brackets [].\n",
    "Example: my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Once created, you cannot change them.\n",
    "Ordered: Elements have a specific order, accessible by index.\n",
    "Syntax: Created using parentheses ().\n",
    "Example: my_tuple = (1, \"hello\", 3.14)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: Can be changed after creation.\n",
    "Unordered: Elements are stored as key-value pairs, and you access values using their keys (not by position).\n",
    "Syntax: Created using curly braces {}.\n",
    "Example: my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable: Can be changed after creation.\n",
    "Unordered: Elements have no specific order. Sets automatically remove duplicate values.\n",
    "Syntax: Created using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.\n",

    "#### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability: Lists, dictionaries, and sets are mutable, while tuples are immutable. This is a crucial difference that affects how you use them.\n",
    "Order: Lists and tuples maintain the order of elements, while dictionaries and sets do not.\n",
